## Introduction to Football Leagues

Football leagues are organized competitions where clubs play each other over a season to determine champions and rankings. Most countries have a **pyramid system** with multiple tiers, allowing promotion and relegation between divisions based on performance.

## Tier System Explained

### Typical League Pyramid
Tier 1: Premier Division (e.g., Premier League, La Liga)
Tier 2: Second Division (e.g., Championship, Segunda División)
Tier 3: Third Division (e.g., League One, Primera Federación)
Tier 4+: Regional/Local Divisions (amateur/semi-professional)


### Promotion and Relegation
- **Top teams** in lower divisions move up
- **Bottom teams** in higher divisions move down
- **Play-offs** often determine final promotion spots
- **Exceptions**: Some leagues have closed systems (no relegation)
