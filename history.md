## Origins and Early Development

Football, known as soccer in some countries, has ancient origins dating back over 2,000 years. The earliest known forms of football-like games were played in China (Cuju), Greece (Episkyros), and Rome (Harpastum). These early games involved kicking a ball and were often part of military training exercises.

### Medieval Football
During the Middle Ages in Europe, various forms of "mob football" emerged, particularly in England. These games had few rules, unlimited players, and were often played between neighboring towns and villages. The games were so violent that they were banned by several kings, including Edward II in 1314.

## The Birth of Modern Football

### The Cambridge Rules (1848)
Students at Cambridge University attempted to standardize the rules, creating what became known as the Cambridge Rules. This was the first attempt to unify the different versions of the game being played at various English public schools.

### The Football Association (1863)
On October 26, 1863, representatives from 11 London clubs and schools met at the Freemasons' Tavern to establish the Football Association (FA). This meeting led to the creation of the first unified rules of football, which notably banned carrying the ball with hands.

### The Split from Rugby (1863)
The FA's decision to ban carrying the ball led to a split with rugby football. Those who preferred handling the ball formed the Rugby Football Union in 1871, creating a clear distinction between association football (soccer) and rugby football.
